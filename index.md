# About Me

Hi! I'm an up and coming web developer looking to break into the industry! I have made front-end web applications using Angular, HTML and JavaScript. I'm also experienced in making back-end applications leveraging Spring Boot and Java. The applications I have created are able to communicate with each other using asynchronous HTTP calls. I have also created SQL databases for data persistence.
